description : 


we implemented a simple linear regression model using the House_Rent_Dataset. The dataset contains various features, such as the number of bedrooms (BHK), rent, size, floor, area type, locality, city, furnishing status, tenant preference, number of bathrooms, and point of contact. The goal was to predict the rent (target variable) based on other continuous and categorical features.

Steps Undertaken:

Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset and inspected its structure.
Handled missing values to ensure data quality.
Converted categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding to prepare them for the regression model.
Feature Selection:

Selected relevant features that could influence the rent. For simplicity, we focused on continuous variables like Size, BHK, and Bathroom.
Splitting Data:

Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
Model Training:

Trained a linear regression model using LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model on the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) on the test data.
Visualized the regression line and plotted actual vs. predicted rent values to assess the model's accuracy.
Visualization:

Created scatter plots to show the relationship between actual and predicted rent values.
Plotted the regression line to visualize the fit of the model.

Conclusion:


The simple linear regression model provided insights into the relationship between house features and rent. Key findings include:

Model Performance:

The model achieved a moderate R-squared value, indicating that a significant portion of the variance in rent can be explained by the selected features.
The Mean Squared Error was reasonable, but there's room for improvement.
Visualization Insights:

The regression line plot showed the model's fit, indicating it captures the general trend but may miss some nuances.
The actual vs. predicted values scatter plot revealed that while the model performs well in many cases, there are discrepancies, suggesting other features or non-linear relationships might be important.
